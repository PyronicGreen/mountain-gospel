      <p>There are some pernicious rumors that've taken root in our collective consciousness...
        <blockquote><em>We're living in the best of times! Things are only getting better! Progress, baby! Corporate Capitalism is the best system ever concocted and will lead to the liberation of everyone worldwide!</em></blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>Don't buy it for a minute. Capitalism in its current form relies on there being a balance of production and consumption. This in and of itself is not the problem. The problem comes when there is manipulation of this system outside of the free market, usually in the form of government or organized crime (Most of the time the two are interchangeable).
      </p>
      <p><strong>The individual is NOT meant to be ruled by a small cabal of oligarchs who've become staggeringly rich by mercilessly raping the earth and keeping us under their heels.<br>The individual is NOT meant to be a tax slave until the day he dies.</strong>
      </p>
      <p> Society and government are meant to serve the individual, not the other way around. Instead it has us believing that we're inseparable cogs in this system that only benefits an ingratiated few. The threat of force or loss of liberty is a pretty strong convincer...</p><br><strong> But what if I told you there was another way...? </strong>
        <b> There is.</b>
        <br><hr>
        <p>This reality we inhabit is one of many systems, and we all choose how we participate. Do we dominate and oppress in our quest to mindlessly consume whatever junk the corporate globalists throw at us? <br><br>
         With the financial systems about to collapse and our natural world being destroyed before our eyes, it's time we take a stand and say "Enough is enough." Integrity, community and ecosystem revitalization must take precedence over coporate greed.</p>
        <p><b>West Kill Gardens</b> is a new vision of society, where permaculture, community strength and open-source technology are our most cherished values. This vision is not one based on a socialist central government that redistributes wealth. Rather, we believe in the rights of the individual, that he or she should be allowed to live an optimal life without the hindrance of government control and oppression. We believe in a single and small land-value tax. All other taxes are a form of government extortion. To read more about the concept of land-value taxes, <a target="_blank" href="http://savingcommunities.org/issues/taxes/landvalue/" title="Saving Communities Website">check out this link</a> which does a pretty good job of explaining it. </p>
      <br>
       <p><b>West Kill Gardens</b> is a 5-acre eco-garden and food-forest in the Catskill Mountains. Our mission is to build a community that prioritizes optimal participation with nature and maintaining a limited government focused on the betterment of all sentient life.<br><br>
